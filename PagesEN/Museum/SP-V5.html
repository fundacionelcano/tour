            In the Tomb T7 (Cal 770 to 965 A.D.) an unknown number of individuals were buried, between twenty-eight and forty-one. The complete bodies and body parts of adult males and females and children were found. The main individual is a child between the ages of 9 and 10. At his side, there was the body of an adult male between 35 and 45 years old and of a similar status.

Bracelets.</span> These were decorated with the image of a supernatural being in the shape of an anthropomorphic bat walking in the opposite direction on each bracelet. Despite going to one side, the head and torso are turned to the front. They have two triangular wings on their backs. The arms are open holding a cane in each hand and a belt hangs on the opposite side to the one they are walking on.

        <p>
            <span class = "gold">13-16 Figurative Pendants.</span> These were all made of of resins. This material is a pasty substance obtained naturally from the organic secretion of certain plants. They were highly valued for their chemical properties, malleability and color. The society of El Caño used them for embalming, as an adhesive, as incense and to make pendants.

            <span class = "gold">24. Perforated human incisors and premolars.</span>  These were part of a necklace. Some ethno-historical references indicate that, at the time of contact, there was a custom in the isthmus of marking prisoners of war by removing their incisor teeth. It is considered for this reason that this necklace and other similar ones found in El Caño were probably used as war trophies. It does not appear on the tomb map. It was found in a package of disjointed human bones.
