            The tomb T6 (Cal 775 to 980 AD) was not found in its entirety. It was partly destroyed when the tombs T1 and T2 were built. Only the bones of the legs of two adult individuals of indeterminate sex and a skull were preserved. All of the artifacts that can be seen in this showcase were found in one corner of the tomb.
