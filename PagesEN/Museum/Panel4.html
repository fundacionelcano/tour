            The Society of El Caño, a Stratified Society
        </h6>
        <p>
            The society of El Caño was grouped according to criteria of wealth, status, social, economic and political power. For the researcher, the accumulation of wealth evident in the tombs of this place suggests inequality and social hierarchy.
            The distribution of power and the way in which it was transmitted was a matter of great interest to the most powerful families.  For that reason, when an important person died, his relatives organized sumptuous funerals, making a great display of wealth and turning them into acts for the exhibition of the status of the deceased and the power of his family.
            Some children were also buried with high status symbols, indicating that people were attached to a certain social position from birth by inheriting the status of their parents.

            The collection
        </h6>
        <p>
            The society of El Caño buried its dead with sets of artifacts of different types: artifacts for the head, ears, nose, neck, chest, waist, arms and legs, and also with tools and weapons. They were not simple adornments, but elements that symbolically represented the person's identity and social role in life.
            People of high social status were buried with a greater number and variety of these artifacts and also with symbols of their status: gold pectorals and bracelets; belts made of sperm whale, puma, and jaguar teeth, or spherical beads lined with gold leaf; large pendants; emeralds; and figures made with manatee ribs. All objects made of materials with a high symbolic value, in some cases the raw materials were imported from outside of what is now Panama.

            What is shown in this room is a sample of the funeral grave goods and offerings of the tombs T1, T2, T4, T5 and T7. In the showcases we have placed the items belonging to the main individuals and those of some of their companions. We have also selected some "liminal (transitional) and post-liminal offerings", objects placed in the tombs a few months after the burials.
