            Burials of Pomp and Human Sacrifice
        </h6>
        <p>
            For years magnificent funerals were organized in El Caño. When an important person of the society died, his relatives built for him a great tomb in the area of the necropolis reserved to the elite. His body was buried covered with riches and surrounded by companions, a variable number of people who were previously sacrificed.
            The victims of the sacrifices were either prisoners or people from the family environment of the deceased. The motivation behind their deaths, as well as the way in which they were treated at the time of death and afterwards, were very different in both cases. The prisoners were people from other communities. Their deaths were intended to strengthen the soul of the deceased with the life force of the victims and also served to show the dominion of the deceased and his relatives over other communities. Relatives, servants, wives, slaves, artisans and farmers were selected from the family environment. These died to accompany and serve the deceased, and because they were people of the house, they received special treatment during the funerary ritual.

            Funerary rituals didn't end with burial. In fact, they lasted for years, during which time the relatives of the deceased would return to his tomb to make other offerings. To finish, they conducted a closing ritual that consisted of the offering of a small child or a doll that was dressed in replicas of the objects of the funeral trousseau of the deceased, but in miniature. This offering was placed inside the tomb as a symbol of rebirth.
            The burial of elite persons with companions is a generally short-lived phenomenon. It is historically observed in different parts of the world during the process of formation of States, which reveals the complex political and religious structure of the society of El Caño between the years 750 and 1000 A.D.
            The funerals and large tombs built in this place were used by the society of El Caño to represent its social order and religious beliefs, but also as a space for political propaganda.

            Iconography of human sacrifice
        </h6>
        <p>
            Five representations related to human sacrifice have been found in El Caño. Three were carved in stone blocks and placed in the ceremonial area of the necropolis. The other two are a pendant and a figure found in two of the tombs in Area 1 of the cemetery (main room: showcase SP-V8, Ref. number 11149 and showcase SP-V3, Ref. number 9290).

            Sculpture of "The jaguar-sacrificer": single scene representing a feline attacking a person. In some pre-Hispanic societies, the felines intervened in the sacrifices or were used as the symbolic representation of the sacrificers.
            Sculpture of “The Prisoner" : Figure sculpted from a stone block originally located in the ceremonial area, very close to the elite tombs of Area 1. It represents an adult male, of high status, beheaded and attached to a monolith.
