            The El Caño Necropolis in Context
        </h6>
        <p>
            The site is located 50 meters above sea level between the rivers Grande and El Caño, on an alluvial plain of clay soils dotted with small volcanic cones. Today it is an area of pastures, large farms for the cultivation of sugarcane, rice, onions and small orchards. Other characteristics are the stronghold of open forest, the forests of galleries on the banks of the rivers, the mangroves and the live fences.
            The environment in which we find ourselves receives the lowest average annual rainfall in the country, just 2000 cubic mm. However, the soils are very rich, and we are close to the sea and its resources. The mountains to the north contain important deposits of gold and copper, basaltic rocks and sedimentary rocks.
        </p> 
        <p>      
            Nearby are some of the oldest pre-Columbian settlements in the isthmus: the Cave of the Vampires occupied at the dawn of the Clovis tradition (12,060 [11,520] 11,020 B.C.), and the Aquadulce shelter (9,000-8,000 B.C.), a site that is also important for containing the first evidence in the region of maize domestication. The first villages have also been found very close to here: in La Mula-Sarguia (cal 760-200 BC) and Sitio Sierra (cal 40 BC - cal 350 AD).
            In the Rio Grande Valley, between 680 and 1020 A.D., when the Necropolis of El Caño was in use, there was a second necropolis, Sitio Conte, and at least two large settlements, in the Rancho Sancho and Cerrezuela sites. All of these settlements belong to the Gran Coclé archaeological tradition, which is why we refer to the inhabitants of the region as "the Coclé".

            The Archaeological Site
        </h6>
        <p>
            The necropolis of El Caño is a complex composed of a cemetery and a ceremonial center. The cemetery is organized in at least two sectors, one of them for the burial of low status persons and the other exclusively for high status persons. The tombs are very different in one sector in comparison to the other sector due to the differential treatment that the tomb occupants received after death. The low status people were buried in simple pits dug in the ground and with few, if any, grave goods.
            In contrast, the Coclé elite and their political and religious leaders were buried with rich funeral goods and prisoners, servants and relatives who were sacrificed to serve as companions. All the bodies were placed inside the same mortuary chamber built of wood and located inside a large pit excavated in the earth. The officiants of the ritual placed thousands of artifacts as offerings on the cover of the mortuary chamber.
        </p> 
        <p>       
            The ceremonial complex is located east of the cemetery and was intended for ritual activities. It consisted of several wooden buildings, alignments of monoliths, sculptures, altars and a road that connected the river with the necropolis. In this area, various rituals were carried out, human sacrifices among them.
            Besides the necropolis, El Caño contains twelve mounds, some of which were razed years ago and have not been well researched. They are composed of occupation floors, layers of waste and large packages of clays. The strata of wastes, as well as the packages of clays, contain secondary urn burials, some of which are from a time much later (1400-1550 A.D.) than the first occupation.

            The Exhibition 
        </h6>
        <p> 
            What you will see is a permanent, systematic, contextualized, didactic and mixed documentary exhibition (with original artifacts and replicas), for which artifacts from the tombs T1, T2, T4, T6 and T7 of Area 1 of El Caño have been selected.
            The exhibition seeks to show, through a scientific view, the life and death of the Coclé, their social structure, mortuary customs and cosmovision. We ask you, as visitors, to make your way through it not only as a journey in time, but also a personal journey of discovery. It will offer you a multitude of exciting possibilities in interaction with other visitors and joint experimentation. Many questions may arise. That is why we encourage you to see it not as the final presentation of a research on El Caño but just the beginning of many others.
