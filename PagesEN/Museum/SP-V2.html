            <span class = "gold">1. Pectoral.</span>  This design represents a supernatural being, a hybrid of squid and bird. If the figure is turned 180º one can discover a pair of facing birds hidden in the head and arms of the squid.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class = "gold">2. Anthropomorphic effigy vessel.</span> All burial tombs of El Caño contain vessels representing the deceased. High status individuals painted the contour of their eyes red as a mask. This one, in particular, personifies the main individual of the T2 tomb. He is decorated with body and facial paintings, which reproduce those worn by the coclé chiefs.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class = "gold">3-4. Tubular earsticks.</span> These are ear ornaments.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class = "gold">5. Pectoral.</span> This was decorated with the image of the Mythic Dragon. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This supernatural being is zoomorphic, a hybrid of bird and reptile, and is formed by the union of the serpentine profiles of two bicephalic crocodiles. The birds are hidden in his head, where the artist uses jaws, teeth, noses and crests to figure the bodies, beaks, heads and wings of two birds in flight.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class = "gold">6. Pectoral.</span> This was embossed with the face of a supernatural being with features of a Mythic Crocodile. The nose, eyes and mouth refer us to the biological base of the crocodile, while the crests and the forked tongue, elements shared with other mythical beings within the semiology of the area, endow it with a supernatural character. The design is framed with a strip of eighteen concentric circles, representing the dermal plates of the crocodiles.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class = "gold">7-8. Bracelets.</span> This was decorated with zigzag designs. Some bodies were shrouded with resins. It is for this reason that certain artifacts, such as these, still have remains of this material attached to them.
        </p>
        <p>    
            <span class = "gold">9. Set of seven crosses.</span> They have a central circle at the intersections of their arms (arrangement quincunce). This design has a tradition of great antiquity and wide diffusion in the iconography of pre-Hispanic America. It is generally interpreted as the graphic embodiment of a conception of the universe composed of four cardinal directions plus the center.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class = "gold">10. Belt.</span> This was elaborated with teeth of animals of great size and strength. By wearing this belt, the user assumes the attributes of these animals which also confer, through ritual and transformation, a mystical and magical power.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class = "gold">11. Pendant sheath.</span> This covered a pendant  of perishable material in the shape of a seahorse.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class = "gold">12. Crystalline green stone perforated.</span> Emeralds were highly valued for their color and for being translucent and shiny. We do not know their exact origin, but it is possible that the emeralds found in El Caño have been imported from one of the emeralds deposits in the department of Boyacá in Colombia (Muzo, Chivor or San Pablo de Borbur). 
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class = "gold">13. Pectoral.</span>  This design represents, in front, a supernatural being with features of Mythic Crocodile. It is fringed with a strip of thirteen concentric circles that appear on the dermal plates of the crocodiles. The icon is the same as the one that has one of the pectorals of the main individual buried in this tomb. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class = "gold">14. Pectoral.</span> This design represents the face of a supernatural being with the features of an old man. It was found together with the pectoral and the bracelets. All these elements formed part of the same mortuary or mortuary ensemble. No human remains were found. It is possible that it was worn by a very small child or a doll that was placed in the tomb as an offering after a while.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class = "gold">15. Pectoral.</span>  This piece is very deteriorated, but one can recognize the image of two supernatural beings, hybrid of bird and reptile, a variant of the theme of the Mythical Dragon. This being, which embodies the heaven/earth duality, is also represented in one of the pectorals associated with the main individual of this tomb.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class = "gold">16-19. Bracelets.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class = "gold">20. Pectoral.</span> This design presents a double perspective, from above we see a quadruped of shortened trunk in position to crawl with the head turned towards the spectator, and from front we see a slightly anthropomorphic being whose head is formed by the union of two heads of crested birds looking in opposite directions.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class = "gold">21-22. Open truncated cone bracelets.</span> Each is embossed with what appears to be the stylized figure of a crocodile in profile, a variant of the Double Mythic Crocodile.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class = "gold">23. Figurative pendant.</span> This represents a naked man, dressed in a headdress and bird mask.  All the features of the figure can be interpreted as a shaman in trance (maraca, gesture of the hand, feet raised, eyes dilated and exorbitant), wearing elements that refer to a harpy eagle (copete and mouth mask).
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class = "gold">24. Figurative pendant.</span> This represents the Mythic Crocodile with tusk shape. The head and upper extremities are presented in front and in detail, while the rest of the body is presented in a very stylized dorsal vision.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class = "gold">25. Figurative pendant.</span>  In this figure, which is very compact, one can distinguish the cephalothorax with four pairs of legs, the face with two pedunculated round eyes, a pair of antennae and two pairs of buccal appendages. The unfolded, rounded abdomen indicates that it is a female.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class = "gold">26. Bell with cylindrical handle.</span> This was decorated with the heads and claws of the Mythic Double Crocodile.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class = "gold">27. Figurative pendant.</span> This represents a bicephalous bat in flight. The nasal leaf identifies it as belonging to the family Phyllostomidae, but the rest of its features seem to mix those of different species. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class = "gold">28.  Figurative pendant.</span> This represents a two-headed man on his foot holding a ceremonial shell trumpet with both hands.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class = "gold">29. Pendant.</span> This represents a supernatural hybrid of jaguar (head) and crocodile (body). On the spine there are two bands of six rhombuses with a central point, a geometric simplification of the dermal plates on the crocodiles. To emphasize the union of the two animals in a single being, the artist placed feline elements in the cover of the crocodile's tail and extended the eyes of the jaguar to resemble those of the crocodiles.
