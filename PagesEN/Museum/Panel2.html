            For a long time, El Caño was the place of pilgrimage of tomb robbers and amateur archaeologists, who came here in search of treasures. The first to try his luck was Hyatt Verrill. In November 1925, he opened trenches at various points in the park, and found two lines of monoliths and a group of stone sculptures, most of which were sold to the Heye Foundation of New York. Years later James Zelsman discovered nine skeletons a few meters south of the monoliths. Shortly thereafter Gerald Doyle unearthed a second tomb very close by.

            Professional Excavations
        </h6>
        <p>
            In 1979 the National Directorate of Historical Heritage took over the administration of the site and managed the first scientific works: the topographic survey of the site, the taking of an aerial infrared photograph, the placement of some sculptures (or rather what was left of them) in their original place, and the partial excavation of the main alignment of monoliths, of mounds M3 and M4 and of the causeway. In 1988 archaeologist Carlos Fitzgerald took some samples from mounds M3 and M4 in an attempt to contextualize the site chronologically. 
            In 2008, with funding from the National Secretariat of Science and Technology of Panama and the National Geographic Society and the support of the National Institute of Culture and the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, archaeologists Julia and Carlos Mayo began an excavation in Area 1 that led them to discover a group of large tombs with multiple burials. Since then, every year during the dry season, they carry out excavations at the site.
            In 2011 the project researchers created a platform for the study of these tombs, the El Caño Foundation, based in the City of Knowledge, Panama City.

            Measures for the Protection and Enhancement of the Site

            In 1973, the company that owned the land inadvertently destroyed several mounds while they were working to prepare the land for sugar cane plantation. The site was inspected by archaeologist Richard Cooke and Mr. Pedro Quirós of the National Directorate of Historical Heritage, who also rescued some mortuary urns. At the same time, Dr. Reina Torres de Arauz, then deputy director general of the National Institute of Culture (INAC) and director of the National Directorate of Historical Heritage, prepared a plan for the site, which culminated in the creation of the El Caño Archaeological Park in 1979. That year is when the museum in which you are located was built, a small building that follows the architectural pattern of the typical peasant house in the “interior”. For thirty years some objects of ceramic, lithic and goldsmithery were exhibited in the museum. 
            The museum closed its doors to the public in 2013.

            El Caño continues to be administered by the National Directorate of Historical Heritage. In 2018 it was declared a patrimony of national interest by the Mayor of Natá de los Caballeros.
            In February of the same year, the El Caño Foundation began to work on a project for its recovery and reopening using funds from INAC, the National Secretariat of Science, Technology (SENACYT), individuals, local businesses and volunteer work. It has been open to the public since April 2019.
