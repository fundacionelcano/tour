            In Tomb T4 (Cal 885 to 1015 A.D.) thirty-two individuals were buried, nineteen of them males, three females, three children and seven adults of indeterminate sex. The main individual is an adult male between the ages of 30 and 45. He was decapitated and placed next to the south wall of the mortuary chamber. At the height of his shoulders was found a head that perhaps was not his.  The head of an individual between 25 and 35 years old, a choker, a gold nose ring and a figurative earring were placed next to the wall on the north side.  
        </p>        
        <p>        
            <span class = "gold">1. Choker.</span>  This is composed of sixty-eight beads in the form of bird feather. The jagged part of the beads represents the down (soft beards found at the base of the feathers), and the elongated part represents the standard.
        </p>        
        <p>       
            <span class = "gold">2. Nosepiece.</span>  This has the shape of a hollow truncated cone. The only decoration on this piece is a thickening that runs along the edges.
        </p>        
        <p>        
            <span class = "gold">3. Vessel effigy.</span> A depiction of a sea ray carrying a vessel or offering on it’s back. 
        </p>         
        <p>      
            <span class = "gold">4. Pectoral.</span> This design is the anthropomorphic embodiment of the Mythical Double Crocodile. The standing figure is represented with a vertical axis of bilateral symmetry. It is bordered with a highlighted band.
        </p>         
        <p>        
            <span class = "gold">5. Bracelet.</span>  This piece was decorated with three anthropomorphic harpy eagles facing each other and with open arms. They have supernatural elements including toothed beaks, eyes in the shape of an inverted tear, and belts.
        </p>         
        <p>       
            <span class = "gold">6. Bracelet.</span> This piece was decorated with three anthropomorphic harpy eagles that walk to their right with open arms. Appendages ending in crocodile heads come from it’s belt.
        </p>        
        <p>       
            <span class = "gold">7. Belt of spherical beads (76 units).</span> Like the belt in tomb T1, the beads do not contain a support, but it is possible that at some point each bead contained a perforated wooden sphere.
        </p>        
        <p>        
            <span class = "gold">8-9. Pendants.</span> This has perforated teeth finished with covers.

        <p>    
            <span class = "gold">10. Figurative pendant.</span> This represents a feline in a vertical position. It is the only case in the iconography of El Caño in which the tusks of the animal are represented.
        </p>        
        <p>       
            <span class = "gold">11. Figure.</span> This represents a lizard, an animal of known symbolism related to death and the underworld in ancient Mesoamerica and among the current indigenous peoples of Panama and Costa Rica. 
        </p>         
        <p>       
            <span class = "gold">12. Zoomorphic chocolate maker.</span> Chocolate makers were ceramics used to drink cocoa. This piece represents an armadillo who walks using only his hind legs while carrying a pot on his shoulders. The handle, a long hollow duct resting on the belly, was used to blow or introduce a stick, in order to make foam. Some chocolatiers found in El Caño have the shape of the cocoa fruit.
        </p>         
        <p>       
            <span class = "gold">13-16. Carinated jars.</span> They were covered with red and white engobes and decorated with simple geometric motifs in black.
