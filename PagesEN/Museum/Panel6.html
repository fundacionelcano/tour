            Coclé iconography
        </h6>
        <p>
            The supernatural world of the Coclé was populated by extraordinary beings that their artists represented with different anthropomorphic, zoomorphic or hybrid forms that, together with elements carrying meanings, expressed metaphorically their qualities and fields of action.
            We see them in pectorals, bracelets, earrings, ceramics and other objects in this exhibition. Some stylistic resources such as specular symmetries, bicephalous, double and quadruple figures, rivalry of contours or double perspectives serve to transmit that these beings had the capacity, to be one and their opposite, to merge or to unfold and quadruple according to the directions of the universe, typical qualities of the gods of great part of the religions of pre-Hispanic America.
            Along with these appear a series of animals that played different roles in their mythical world, especially as mediators with the Underworld, as well as some scenes from the story of the funerary ritual and the journey to the Beyond.

            Traveling to the beyond

            In the middle of the room there are four special artifacts that were part of the mortuary goods of the main individuals buried in tombs T1, T2, T4 and T7. Artistically and conceptually exceptional, they present us with "mono scenes", frozen moments in which some episodes of the funerary ritual and the mythical account of the trip of the deceased of high status to the afterlife are represented.
            Due to their theme, the singularity of the use of narrative techniques and their adaptation to the context, they could be objects whose function was to mark the transition phase between life and death.
