            SP&#8209;V6: Figurative pendant.
        </h6>
        <p>
            This piece shows a pair of spiny lobsters carrying human heads with lifeless faces on their shells. The figure, duplicated for reasons of style, depicts the deceased being moved by a lobster to its destination beyond the grave. The pendant is missing two components that, made of precious stones, resins or other materials, would be stuffed into the bottom of each of the lobsters representing their abdomen and tail.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is possible that the Cocles associated the lobsters with the underworld for living in caves and having nocturnal habits. Its scavenging character and its activities also postulate it to play the role of a psychopomp animal, in charge of guiding souls to the afterlife. The annual moult of its exoskeleton links it with vital regeneration.

            This pendant has a double interpretation. If looked at vertically, as it is presented here, one can see a male of high status who is seated, whose body has been replaced by two twin birds, with the exception of neck and head which shows lifeless features. Horizontally, the birds are guiding the head of the male of high status. The figure conveys the same idea in both positions: a deceased person or his soul, flying or traveling towards his destination beyond the grave, guided by two birds. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Birds are metaphors for the flight and communication between worlds and the head is a metaphor for the whole man or his animal.

            SP&#8209;V8: Figurative pendant.

        <p>     
            This piece shows a ritually dressed human figure that has plucked out one eye and appears to be plucking out the other. He wears a perforated emerald partially embedded in his belly. He is performing is a sacrificial self-mutilation.
        </p>
        <p>
            In Amerindian iconography we find images of eyes torn out and one-eyed in sacrificial and mortuary contexts since the formative period. In Mesoamerica, the eyes outside the orbits hanging from the optic nerve is a conventional way of transmitting the relationship of a figure with death, just as appearing without eyes is a typical feature of the animated dead and moche ancestors in the Andean world.

            SP&#8209;V9: Figure.

        <p>   
            This piece shows a supernatural entity in the form of an anthropomorphic fishering bat, standing with open limbs, catching two sharks with its hands. It is possible that this scene narrates one of the avatars through which the soul of the deceased has to pass to enter the underworld.
        </p>
        <p>
            The bat is widely represented since the formative period in the iconographies of the Intermediate Area, Mesoamerica and northern Peru, but this particular icon seems to be typical of our area where it is represented with small variations in seven gold pectorals of Conte and Parita styles. It has been associated with death, the underworld, human sacrifice and fertility. On the other hand, sharks are also associated with the underworld, as the sea is considered the entrance to it.
