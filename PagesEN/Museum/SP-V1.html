            In the Tomb T1 (Cal 780 to 970 A.D.) eight individuals were buried. The main one is an adult of indeterminate sex. This adult was accompanied by a twelve-year-old child of high status, and six individuals of low status: a child, two adult women, an adult male and two adults of indeterminate sex.

            <span class = "gold">1. Bracelet.</span> This was decorated with two anthropomorphic crocodiles that, bound by a belt, walk upright in the opposite direction. The pair has the same design. Iconographically it is a variant of a central theme in Cocle art: the Mythic Double Crocodile.
        </p>        
        <p>       
            <span class = "gold">2. Zoomorphic vessel.</span> This represents a female monkey with its two offspring.
        </p>         
        <p>        
            <span class = "gold">3. Spherical beads.</span> These were woven in a band forming small clusters.
        </p>         
        <p>       
            <span class = "gold">4&#8209;5. Pectorals.</span> Their designs are two representations of a hybrid squid and bird: the 
            Flying Squid. It has elements of supernaturality such as the forked tongue (which at the 
            same time figures to be a pair of arms) and the belt (which is also the two fins unfolded). 
            If we turn the figure 180º we discover a pair of birds hidden in its head.
        </p>         
        <p>      
            <span class = "gold">6. Bracelet of Bells (39 units).</span> The bells were used in religious ceremonies, rites and dances, 
            and their use was restricted to the ruling class. 
        </p>             
        <p>      
            <span class = "gold">7. Belt.</span> This is composed of 63 spherical beads. It is possible that, at the time, each of them 
            had a core of wood. These would give them weight and consistency. Without them they are extremely 
                fragile and easily deformed. 
        </p>        
        <p>     
            <span class = "gold">8. Tubular beads (384 units).</span> These were sewn to two greaves. Greaves are garments used to dress 
            and protect the legs. 
        </p>       
        <p>      
            <span class = "gold">9. Zoomorphic jar.</span> This was modeled in the shape of a bird carrying a vessel (offering) on its 
            head.  It is the metaphorical representation of one of the officiants of the funerary ritual. It 
            was placed inside the tomb one year after the burial.

        <p>     
            <span class = "gold">10&#8209;11. Axes.</span> The handle on the axes was placed parallel to the edge.
        </p>        
        <p>     
            <span class = "gold">12. Adze.</span>  Adzes were used for roughing wood and probably also as hoes for weeding. The handle, in 
            this type of artifact, was placed perpendicular to the edge. 
        </p>            
        <p>      
            <span class = "gold">13&#8209;17. Honing tools.</span> These tools were used to brighten or polish a ceramic or metal object.
        </p>        
        <p>     
            <span class = "gold">18. Figurative Pendant. </span> This represents a pelican with its head turned and resting on its back. 
            It was part of a necklace made up of feline canines.
