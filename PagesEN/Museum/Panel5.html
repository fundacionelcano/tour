            Funerary Rituals
        </h6>
        <p>
            We all go through life, from our youth to our death and as part of our social development, through numerous transitions. To mark and symbolize these transitions all societies organize rites of passage. The funerary ritual is a type of rite of passage, constituted by a set of activities that celebrate death and that symbolize our final transition.
        </p>
        <p>       
            In the past, these rituals had the potential to materialize dominant ideologies, create a separation between the dead and the living, and re-establish the social character of the deceased in the collective memory, often in the form of an ancestor. Moreover, as social acts, funerary rituals contributed to the cohesion of the group and the construction of its identity. 
        </p>
        <p>      
            Like any other rites of passage, funerary rituals are structured in three phases: a separation or pre-liminal phase in which the elimination of the individual from his position in life is symbolized; a transition or liminal phase in which the deceased no longer holds their pre-ritual status and begins their journey to the world of the dead;and an incorporation or post-liminal phase that represents the adoption of a new identity after death.
