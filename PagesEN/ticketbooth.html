            The Necropolis of El Caño represents a traditional Coclé society. The creation of El Caño is the culmination of a long process of economic, political, social and religious development that began in the region around 500 A.D. The site was built in 700 A.D. and abandoned in 1000 A.D.

            Traditionally, it had been thought that the societies of the Isthmus of Panama, as well as others of the Intermediate Area or Lower Central America, were egalitarian or moderately hierarchical societies, i.e. groups that lived a simple village life, harvesting the land and complementing their diet with hunting and fishing. However, a decade of research in El Caño has provided strong evidence of complexity and led to questioning of these traditional views.

            The organization of the mortuary space based on status (i.e. the segregation of rich and poor within the cemetery) and the presence of rich tombs of infants, highlights that El Caño was a society with great social inequalities. The practice of human sacrifices in the funerary rituals of their political and religious leaders also demonstrates the great factual and social power their rulers had and the particular historical moment they were going through. Finally, the abandonment of the necropolis suggests an exhausted political model in crisis around 1000 A.D. and the beginning of a new period.
