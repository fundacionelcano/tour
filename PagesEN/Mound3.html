            When Mound 3 was first excavated it was a small hill, similar to the ones that still exists to the north and south of it. Two different types of burials were discovered in it. The first type are primary burials, where the person is buried in an extended or laid out position. The second type were secondary burials, which were the bones of a person that were gathered after the body decomposed and buried in a bundle or ceramic container.
