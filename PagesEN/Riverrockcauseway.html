            This structure is a cobble stone causeway currently 17 meters long and 4.5 meters wide. It is believed that during the time the necropolis was in use, the causeway connected it to the Rio Grande River, located 460 meters east of the site. It is likely that the funeral parties arrived at the necropolis via the river and causeway. The funeral procession would have included the deceased, family members, servants, prisoners, and musicians.
